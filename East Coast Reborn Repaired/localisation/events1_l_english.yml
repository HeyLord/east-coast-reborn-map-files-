  DEV_event.1.d:0 "Over the past two centuries, this tiny piece of land has been known as the 'Kingdom of Larry', 'Republic of Stevie-Rey', 'Billsylvania', 'New Republic of Stevie-Ray', and, most recently, 'Tom's Kingdom,' after Dave's father. Tom's son Dave questioned the rule of the monarch, forcing Tom to expel Dave into the Capital Wasteland. However, Dave later returned and wrested power from his father. Dave changed the regime of state rule from monarchy to republic, giving the nation his own name, and giving citizens freedom of democracy in the form of elections. Dave won the nation's first election as the only candidate on the ballot, and has won in a similar manner every election since.\nAfter Dave's first landslide victory, he focused his first term on..."

However, some question if he is too hotheaded to lead\nRosie is Dave's wife.

  ENC_event.5.t:0 "Operation 'Yellow Devil'"
  ENC_event.5.d:0 "Our brave Enclave troops have entered the land of Super Mutants, but we lack a clear battle plan. The Enclave higher-ups require a quick capture of these lands as they believe that these mutants pose no threat to the well-armed and well-trained troops of the Enclave, but we should not underestimate our enemy.\n\nSome of our generals suggest an all out attack. It may cost us good soldiers, but their stories will bring glory to the Enclave!\nOthers suggest a more careful approach, saving our soldiers' lives but hurting your political reputation. What do we do?"
  ENC_event.5.a:0 "All out attack!"
  ENC_event.5.b:0 "A slower approach."

  ENC_event.6.t:0 "Operation 'Dead City'"
  ENC_event.6.d:0 "Recently, the population in the Enclave has gone up sharply. Although our new citizens have settled in nicely, many in the Enclave are looking to expand across the East Coast. One of our Colonels, 'John Niemann', suggested a plan to seize the lands of New York. Many supported his plan and Operation 'Dead City' was put into play...\nNow, a few weeks later, everything is ready. Hundreds of troops travel two hours by truck, arriving in the desolate territory. New York is inhabited by a terrible disease that transforms its victims into brainless zombies. You and your men see the perfect landing zone, although it is covered in hordes of undead."

Every day our soldiers kill crowds of infected, cartridges flying away like the wind. Colonel John Niemann, responsible for the Enclave in New York, filed a formal request for a resupply of good weapons. Do we fulfill his request?"

  ENC_event.10.d:0 "Our troops in New York are asking for scientists to study a disease that has torn through New York. The infected, just like all things, go down if you put a few bullets in em, but why not use science instead?
  ENC_event.10.a:0 "Send in the eggheads!"

  ENC_event.11.t:0 "Autopsy the Infected"
  ENC_event.11.d:0 "Our scientists have started studying the pathogenesis of the disease and are already beginning to get promising results. As it turns out, Leukocytes and Platelets with prolonged exposure to radiation in the brain cause Atherosclerotic plaques. In most cases, the large passage through which the Erythrocytes pass isn't open, but Erythrocytes under the influence of such plaques open passages throughout the whole body, gradually spreading this unknown substance to all human organs and tissues. Our scientists called this substance 'HeliRadPilori' ... after long-term experiments on 'HeliRadPilori', our scientists were able to achieve some success and show a sustainable homeopathic preparation that helps fight this disease, but it is still far from complete."
  ENC_event.11.a:0 "Those are some big words... get back to work!"

  ENC_event.12.t:0 "First Studies"
  ENC_event.12.d:0 "Scientists, protected by our soldiers, went to investigate the neighborhoods of New York in search of the infected. They want to study their behavior and possibly perform some live autopsies with the help of the soldiers... but something went terribly wrong.\nA strong wind knocked some large bells over, apparently launching a mechanism that had been dormant for years. Dozens of scientists and soldiers were infected, leading to a bloody firefight. Only a few of our men made it out, and stories of their massacre are spreading rapidly."
  ENC_event.12.a:0 "This is a real tragedy for the Enclave."

  ENC_event.13.t:0 "Vaccine"
  ENC_event.13.d:0 "A new battalion was dispatched to the sight of the massacre, far better prepared than last time. They were able to inject a live subject with one of the early vaccination tests. Soldier and doctor alike watched and waited for a reaction. 2 hours later, the subject's behaviors changed completely. He stopped being aggressive, started asking questions... a fantastic success! Only a nation like the Enclave could beat such a deadly disease! But this is only an isolated case; further testing showed this vaccine is far from perfect. 37% of the test subjects die, and the 63% that remains still report random fits of rage. However, this operation was a great success. Dozens of cured New Yorkers are making their way back to the Enclave, eagar to join our ranks!
  ENC_event.13.a:0 "This is a triumph of science!"

  ENC_event.14.t:0 "The End of the Contagion"
  ENC_event.14.d:0 "The past few weeks of innocuation have yielded great results. Improvements to the vaccine have allowed us to cure a majority of New York. That being said, the Brotherhood of Steel have been less excited about our success. They attacked one of our convoys and stole cases of the vaccine destined for the inhabitants of Brookhaven. The Brotherhood immediatly started innocuating their own citizens, bringing hundreds of citizens into their cause. The Brotherhood must be stopped!

Putting the laser musket on his back, Preston hurried to the poor man's aid. Despite the severity of his injuries, the man held on tightly and while the minutemen gave him first aid, asking: "Thank you for your help, without you I would have met my end.
