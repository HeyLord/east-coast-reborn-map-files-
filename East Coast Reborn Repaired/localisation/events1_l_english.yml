Tom's son Dave questioned the rule of the monarch, forcing Tom to expel Dave into the Capital Wasteland. However, Dave later returned and wrested power from his father. Dave changed the regime of state rule from monarchy to republic, giving the nation his own name, and giving citizens freedom of democracy in the form of elections. Dave won the nation's first election as the only candidate on the ballot, and has won in a similar manner every election since.\nAfter Dave's first landslide victory, he focused his first term on..."

However, some question if he is too hotheaded to lead\nRosie is Dave's wife.

  ENC_event.5.d:0 "Our brave Enclave troops have entered the land of Super Mutants, but we lack a clear battle plan. The Enclave higher-ups require a quick capture of these lands as they believe that these mutants pose no threat to the well-armed and well-trained troops of the Enclave, but we should not underestimate our enemy.\n\nSome of our generals suggest an all out attack. It may cost us good soldiers, but their stories will bring glory to the Enclave!\nOthers suggest a more careful approach, saving our soldiers' lives but hurting your political reputation.

One of our Colonels, 'John Niemann', suggested a plan to seize the lands of New York. Many supported his plan and Operation 'Dead City' was put into play...\nNow, a few weeks later, everything is ready. Hundreds of troops travel two hours by truck, arriving in the desolate territory. New York is inhabited by a terrible disease that transforms its victims into brainless zombies. You and your men see the perfect landing zone, although it is covered in hordes of undead."

  ENC_event.11.d:0 "Our scientists have started studying the pathogenesis of the disease and are already beginning to get promising results. As it turns out, Leukocytes and Platelets with prolonged exposure to radiation in the brain cause Atherosclerotic plaques. In most cases, the large passage through which the Erythrocytes pass isn't open, but Erythrocytes under the influence of such plaques open passages throughout the whole body, gradually spreading this unknown substance to all human organs and tissues. Our scientists called this substance 'HeliRadPilori' ... after long-term experiments on 'HeliRadPilori', our scientists were able to achieve some success and show a sustainable homeopathic preparation that helps fight this disease, but it is still far from complete."

  ENC_event.12.d:0 "Scientists, protected by our soldiers, went to investigate the neighborhoods of New York in search of the infected. They want to study their behavior and possibly perform some live autopsies with the help of the soldiers... but something went terribly wrong.\nA strong wind knocked some large bells over, apparently launching a mechanism that had been dormant for years. Dozens of scientists and soldiers were infected, leading to a bloody firefight. Only a few of our men made it out, and stories of their massacre are spreading rapidly."

  ENC_event.13.d:0 "A new battalion was dispatched to the sight of the massacre, far better prepared than last time. They were able to inject a live subject with one of the early vaccination tests. Soldier and doctor alike watched and waited for a reaction. 2 hours later, the subject's behaviors changed completely. He stopped being aggressive, started asking questions... a fantastic success! Only a nation like the Enclave could beat such a deadly disease! But this is only an isolated case; further testing showed this vaccine is far from perfect. 37% of the test subjects die, and the 63% that remains still report random fits of rage. However, this operation was a great success. Dozens of cured New Yorkers are making their way back to the Enclave, eagar to join our ranks!
  ENC_event.13.a:0 "This is a triumph of science!"

  ENC_event.14.t:0 "The End of the Contagion"
  ENC_event.14.d:0 "The past few weeks of innocuation have yielded great results. Improvements to the vaccine have allowed us to cure a majority of New York. That being said, the Brotherhood of Steel have been less excited about our success. They attacked one of our convoys and stole cases of the vaccine destined for the inhabitants of Brookhaven. The Brotherhood immediatly started innocuating their own citizens, bringing hundreds of citizens into their cause. The Brotherhood must be stopped!

  PIT_event.1.t:0 "History of the Pitt"
  PIT_event.1.d:0 "The Pre-War city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania was a town built around the mining and refining of metals. The city was not targeted during the Great War, but the situation in Pittsburgh quickly became one of the worst in the Wasteland. The city underwent a more gradual radiation as nuclear fallout poisoned the water supply. The entire population of the city underwent a mutation unlike any other. Generation after generation, the residents of Pittsburgh grew more grotesque: children were born with growths and rudimentary limbs. Soon, the evaporation of contaminated water changed Pittsburgh's sky: the clouds turned red and the wind brought sandstorms. The desolate and hopeless atmosphere turned the residents of Pittsburgh into monsters. They were ruthless and violent, with some turning to cannibalism. Those who completely lost their minds became known as trogs: creatures incapable of speech and only focused on the consumtion of human meat."
  PIT_event.1.a:0 "Now I know why they call it the PIT_event..."

  PIT_event.2.d:0 "In 2255, en route to Washington from West Coast, a Brotherhood squad commanded by Owen Lyons passed through PIT_event. There they witnessed the epidemic raging in the city. Lyons decided that the merciful thing to do was destroy all the hostile population: cannibals, savages, raiders and trogs alike. The squad was given the task of picking up any valuable equipment that could be carried away. The clearing of the city took place without any problems, the losses among the soldiers of the Brotherhood were minimal, with only one Initiate being lost - Ishmael Ashur. For unknown reasons, an explosion occurred while Initiate Ashur was clearing a building, causing him to fall to a lower level. The Brotherhood assumed him to be dead but never could find his corpse."

  PIT_event.3.d:0 "Ashur awoke to find himself in an old steelmill surrounded by the survivors of the Brotherhood Scourge. The Brotherhood of Steel was long gone, leaving behind piles of bodies. However, the people of the steelmill were joyous; many of the victims of the Scourge were the most violent and deranged denizens of the PIT_event. Convinced that the Power Armor-clad Ashur was a god sent to save them, Paladin Ashur was quickly appointed their leader. Ashur himself decided to stay in the city and protect these people, and Ashur's knowledge and organizational skills allowed the city to flourish. Ashur did what he could to teach the citizens of the Pitt empathy and kindness. Despite this, over time,  disease still turned into a pressing problem for the people of the Pitt, and citizens alone could not keep society running. Gradually and reductantly, Ashur introduced slavery to PIT_event. Although it went against his values, he knew it was the only way his people would survive. With his empire secured, Ashur turned to the biggest issue the Pitt faced: the spreading of "Troglodyte Degeneraction Contagion", or TDC. The disease was twisting his people into flesh-hungry cannibals, and without a cure, his people would be at risk."
