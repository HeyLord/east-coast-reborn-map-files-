 SBS_focus_1:0 "Galaxy News Radio"
 SBS_focus_1_desc:0 "Radio Galaxy News has existed on the territory of the Capital Wasteland for several years, and recently a local DJ, Three Dog, approached us with a proposal: he asks us to protect the radio building from supermutants, and in return we'll get an important strategic point in the center of D.C."
 SBS_focus_2:0 "Volunteers of the Capital Wasteland"
 SBS_focus_2_desc:0 "Our signing of a contract with a local radio station is bearing first fruits, after Three Dog started talking about us all over the wasteland, more and more volunteers are asking to join our ranks, and although some brothers do not like the idea of accepting "locals" into our ranks, but still we need to replenish the ranks of the Brotherhood, after heavy losses in the fights against supermutants"
 SBS_focus_3:0 "Liberation From Oppression"
 SBS_focus_3_desc:0 "We learned from our new initiates that the Rock Hills raiders have been terrorizing local residents for a long time, destroying this gang, we could strengthen our position in D.C., as well as enlist the support of local residents."
 SBS_focus_4:0 "Our Right"
 SBS_focus_4_desc:0 "As a technocratic organisation, every piece of tech is rightfully ours. We do not steal technology out of malice or spite, we take it away to protect the innocents who will inevitably misuse it. Although people don't always understand, everything we do is ultimately to keep the wasteland safe. Our understanding of technology is second to none."
 SBS_focus_5:0 "Salvaged Metal"
 SBS_focus_5_desc:0 "Metal salvage is easy to come by. Twisted scraps of metal are as common as dirt in the wasteland, protruding from buildings, buried in the earth like weeds, and strewn across streets like rubbish. Salvaging the metal in our immediate area will provide us with more resources for our equipment."
 SBS_focus_6:0 "Increase Power Production"
 SBS_focus_6_desc:0 "Generators are both a blessing and a curse. They produce large amounts of energy at relatively low operating costs, but they require certain fuel cells and are difficult to convert to corn fuel. Investing in power generation will have a positive impact on the production of our equipment."
 SBS_focus_7:0 "Salvaged Electronics"
 SBS_focus_7_desc:0 "Salvaging electronics is much more difficult than salvaging metal, in part due to the delicate nature of most electronics. At best, pulling the wiring and circuitry from radios, robots, and broken energy weapons will provide us with more scrap electronics for future projects."
 SBS_focus_8:0 "Advanced Tech"
 SBS_focus_8_desc:0 "Gathering rare technology is not only difficult, but dangerous. Often, the locations where rare pre-war technology can be found are also filled with killer robots, deadly radiation, or other hazards. Still, gathering advanced tech will allow us to create numerous high-end pieces of equipment, so it must be done."
 SBS_focus_10:0 "Our Might"
 SBS_focus_10_desc:0 "The Brotherhood of Steel is feared and respected throughout the wasteland for our military might. In terms of combat effectiveness, we are high above the dregs the wasteland has to offer. One man in power armour is worth ten unarmoured soldiers, if not more. Studying previous engagements will help us improve our future combat doctrine."
 SBS_focus_11:0 "Steel Legions"
 SBS_focus_11_desc:0 "Standing side by side our men form a wall of unbreakable strength. The Brotherhood is like one long chain, spread out across the continent, with many, many links throughout its length. No part of the Brotherhood is weak, every man and woman is trained to a level of proficiency other groups can only dream of."
 SBS_focus_12:0 "Wastelander Conscripts"
 SBS_focus_12_desc:0 "Wastelanders are a dime a dozen, with little special or unique about them. Often short sighted, brutish, and too simple to understand the danger of technology: we often avoid them like the plague. Still, sometimes, new blood is required. At times like these, we hunt the population for worthy candidates, often accepting proven and friendly wastelanders into our ranks."
 SBS_focus_13:0 "New Initiates"
 SBS_focus_13_desc:0 "We're more than just a military organisation, the Brotherhood is one large family. Our knights, paladins, and scribes are all free to pursue relationships, marry, and have children. This is how the Brotherhood survives. When these children come of age, they become initiates, and start their training for their respective discipline."
 SBS_focus_14:0 "Flesh Before Steel"
 SBS_focus_14_desc:0 "\"The flesh is weak,\" a common phrase with a vastly different meaning to others than to us. In the Brotherhood, this phrase is said to express and accept that the human body is frail. Even with our power armour we are still human, and unless the body inside the armour has been trained properly, it will die off long before the armour breaks. All initiates are trained to understand this: weakness is human."
 SBS_focus_15:0 "T-45d Production"
 SBS_focus_15_desc:0 "T-45d was the first model of power armour produced by America, and it shows. A simple frame, lacklustre servos, exposed weak points and a less than impressive helmet design. Still, any power armour is better than none, and its simplicity makes it faster to fix and produce."
 SBS_focus_16:0 "Basic Arms for Basic People"
 SBS_focus_16_desc:0 "Even wastelanders recruited into our ranks cannot be expected to understand technology as well as we do. In order to prevent any unfortunate accidents, we provide wasteland recruits with simpler energy weapons until they've proven themselves capable. Naturally, this means we produce and salvage many weapons ahead of time for new recruits."
 SBS_focus_17:0 "Elder Lyons"
 SBS_focus_17_desc:0 "Elder Lyons has been leading the Capital Brotherhood for many years, and although the West has disowned us, many still support his leadership."
 SBS_focus_18:0 "Scientific Department of the Citadel"
 SBS_focus_18_desc:0 "Since the foundation of the Citadel, our scribes have been working hard to find a use for the old archival records stored in the local terminals."
 SBS_focus_19:0 "Clear Washington"
 SBS_focus_19_desc:0 "The ruins of Washington are dominated by super mutants and raiders who kill and rob the locals. \nIt's time for us to clean up the ruins of Washington."
 SBS_focus_20:0 "Help Those In Need"
 SBS_focus_20_desc:0 "Taking control of the ruins of Washington, Lyons decides to open a transit point to help the wounded brothers and the inhabitants of the Capital Wasteland."
 SBS_focus_21:0 "The Might of the Brotherhood"
 SBS_focus_21_desc:0 "After many years of fighting, we were finally able to take control of the ruins of Washington, it raised the morale of the soldiers, and the wastelanders consider us heroes."
 SBS_focus_22:0 "Expedition to New York"
 SBS_focus_22_desc:0 "The people of New York have come to us for help, what are your orders, Elder?"
 SBS_focus_23:0 "Send Reinforcements"
 SBS_focus_23_desc:0 "Our brothers are experiencing an acute shortage of human resources due to the tragedy that occurred upon their arrival in New York, if we send them reinforcements, it will help them a lot."
 SBS_focus_24:0 "Send Weapons"
 SBS_focus_24_desc:0 "When the barge sank, almost the entire arsenal intended for military operations in New York sank with it, if we send our brothers weapons, this could significantly improve their situation in New York."
 SBS_focus_25:0 "Send Scribes"
 SBS_focus_25_desc:0 "Our brothers from New York are asking to send scribes to study a local disease, which, according to them, turns people into something similar to ghouls. This is quite interesting information, we should send our scribes to study this phenomenon."
 SBS_focus_26:0 "Restoration of Combat Capability"
 SBS_focus_26_desc:0 "Our brothers have fully recovered their strength and are now capable of decisive action."
 SBS_focus_27:0 "The New York Vendetta"
 SBS_focus_27_desc:0 "Elder Lyons advises the New York branch of the Brotherhood of Steel to immediately begin preparations for war with the New York Enclave."
 SBS_focus_36:0 "Liberty Prime"
 SBS_focus_36_desc:0 "The Enclave has returned and captured the cleaner, the war with the Enclave is approaching, which means that it's time to prepare our best weapon..."
 SBS_focus_38:0 "Continue the War With Super Mutants"
 SBS_focus_38_desc: "Now that the enclave has fallen, nothing prevents us from ending the war with the super mutants."
 SBS_focus_39:0 "Return to Pittsburgh"
 SBS_focus_39_desc: "In the past, our brothers have already been to Pittsburgh, where they mined a significant number of different technologies, now Pittsburgh is reborn, we must return to these lands again ..."
 SBS_focus_45:0 "Project Purity"
 SBS_focus_45_desc: "After the victory over the enclave, the brotherhood began to restore the work of the water purifier and now finally we will drink clean water."
 sbs_arm_foundries:0 "Arms Foundries"
 sbs_arm_foundries_desc:0 "We cannot spread and uphold our doctrine without force, and we cannot apply force effectively if our men are under-supplied. If the Brotherhood is to continue its operations, we must not only take technology from the hands of settlers, but produce it ourselves."
 sbs_civilian_workshops:0 "Civilian Workshops"
 sbs_civilian_workshops_desc:0 "Many of the bunkers and bases we seek to occupy were not left untouched by the Great War, and they require extensive repairs and excavation efforts to become fully usable. To ensure that we're prepared for future construction efforts, we should begin to develop a small industrial base of our own."
 sbs_combined_operations:0 "Combined Operations"
 sbs_combined_operations_desc:0 "Learning to fight alongside former wastelanders can be difficult. Their wild, survivalist minded style of combat can often be hectic and unpredictable. This is precisely why recruiting them can be so valuable, and why fitting them into our command structure is so beneficial. That wild, unpredictable nature only makes our squads more effective than before."
 adams_base:0 "Hangars of the Adams Base"
 adams_base_desc:0 "After defeating the Enclave, we were able to gain access to their hangars, where we found the Enclave's Vertibirds in working condition"
elder_sarah:0 "Elder Sarah"
elder_sarah_desc:0 "The death of Elder Lyons was a great loss for us, but now his daughter, a talented fighter and the head of the Lyons' Pride, Sarah Lyons, has taken his place as an elder.\nIn her speech, she said that under her leadership, the Capital Wasteland will finally be rid of the threat of super mutants and the problem with Outcasts will be solved."
asserting_control:0 "Strange Silence "
asserting_control_desc:0 "As promised by Elder Sarah, the Brotherhood began to restore order in the Capital Wasteland, but for some reason, the Brotherhood met only small detachments of supermutants. The ruins of Washington, which were overflowing with supermutants, are empty, where did they go?"

dave_integration:0 "Union with the Republic"
dave_integration_desc:0 "Dave's Republic is a strange community, but despite its strangeness, it has a certain weight in the political arena of the Capital Wasteland. Let's try to convince them to join us without unnecessary bloodshed."
